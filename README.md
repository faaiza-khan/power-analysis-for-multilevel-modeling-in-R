# power-analysis-for-multilevel-modeling-in-R
There's no clear-cut way to estimate power in multilevel contexts. I planned to run an experiencing sampling study with repeated measures of emotional valence and social context, along with one-time measurements of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance. I wrote the following R code to figure out (a) sample size and (b) number of experience sampling measurements required to ensure at least 80% power for all main and interaction effects of interest. 

The code simulates data for one such study, replicates that study 1000 times, and runs a two-level model on each dataset. The Simulation function allows most model parameters to be varied (if you want to play around with the effect of changing certain parameters on power). 

The dependent variable in the multi-level model I ran is emotional valence. It is referred to as Valence in the code and is measured on a scale from 1-7. The Level 1 independent variable is social context (whether participants were alone or with others at the time of the measurement). It is referred to as Alone in the code and is a binary variable. The Level 2 independent variables are attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance. They are referred to as Anxiety and Avoidance in the code, and are both measured on a scale from 1-7. Any assumptions made (e.g., correlation between the Level 2 independent variables) are detailed in the R script.
